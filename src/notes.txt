Use multithreading to release the ships, storing enemy ships into a queue? or any data structure idk
    -this means enemy ships have to be a separate class implementing runnable with a run method
I think the laser should run automatically (I will create a timer for that)


**I think we should approach the graphics as objects possibly and using the method calls in the main function**

What needs Graphics classes
    - background screen (so it halts when you die)
    - enemy ships
    - timer
    - score count
    - lasers: they will end up interacting with the enemy ships

for background screen, we should think about a menu and a score board





I know this is a lot but I want to secure an A in at least 1 class .-.
